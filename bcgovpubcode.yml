  product_description: >-
    The soil relocation provisions in the Environmental Management Act (EMA)
    were amended in March 2020 (Bill 3) to streamline requirements, establish a
    robust and transparent notification system, and introduce additional
    requirements for sites receiving high soil volumes across the province.
    These changes will ensure soil is being relocated appropriately and will
    improve ENV oversight. Subsequently, changes to the Contaminated Sites
    Regulation (CSR) are required to align with the amendments to EMA. The
    online form is needed to support this initiative. The Soil Relocation
    Information System (SRIS) was established to display soil relocation
    notifications and high volume receiving site registrations and to allow
    Indigenous Nations, local governments and other interested people to access
    information on soil relocation activity in B.C.
